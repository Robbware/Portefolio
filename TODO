TO DO:

- I should decide on what kind of message I want to give the user through my website's design.

- Website content:
  - Github link
  - Videos of my work
  - Images (with description)
  - about me (literally about me, linkedin link maybe)


- Simple and elegant. A simple navbar, an image which identifies me and my work. Logo? must think.
get references.
